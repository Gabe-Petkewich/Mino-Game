Heyo, so for those of you that aren't familiar with git bash (as I was before today), I'm gonna give some pointers to commiting and 
pushing the changes you make up to this repo.
 
1) Make sure you've cloned this repo to some local code file you've got.
2) Make your changes or whatever
3) Then open git bash from the file folder (right click in your file explorer and make sure the files you see are the same as what files
   are visibile on github)
4) Typing `git status` shows you what's been changed locally I believe
5) `git commit -a -m "prototype"` - is a sample commit message. The '-a' flag commits all files, and '-m' adds your commit message.
6) 'git push' then sends it here to the repo. If you ever have issues, typing 'git status' usually helps you see what step you're on,
   even though this is pretty straight forward.
   
   
 
 From here, we need to work on our Game Design Document. I'll be sending the sample doc from the meeting in the GroupMe.
